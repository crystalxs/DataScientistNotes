# 3.2. Data Structure

Data structures group or encode relationships between data elements.

#### Advice

* Using the simplest data structure you can initially

* Wasting processor, memory power before brianpower
* There is a trade off between time and space (always)
* Prep work or more sophisticated data structure can help (???)

## Methods

- Physical adjacency or relative position in RAM
- Pointers

## Type

| Abstract data type | Implementation data type |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| list               | array                    |
| dictionary         | hashtable                |
|                    |                          |

### Elemental data in memory

#### Python built-in atomic data type

* Numeric: `int`, `float`;
* Boolean: `bool` (`True` / `False`).

#### Python built-in collection data type

* List: an ordered collection of zero or more references to Python data objects, **heterogeneous**;
* String
* Tuple
* Set
* Dictionary

### Pointer Data Type

A pointer p is implemented as an integer variable that holds a memory address.

* All the variable in python is a reference to the piece of data and not data itself
