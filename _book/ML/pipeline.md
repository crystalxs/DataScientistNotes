# Pipeline

- Pipelines makes code more readable
- Pipelines makes it easy to change the order or add/remove steps
- You only have to call `fit` and `predict` once
- Easy to write grid search over multiple parameters

## Typical ML Workflow

1. Load tidy data
2. Split into train and test sets
3. Do feature engineering
4. Choose hyperparameters
5. Fit model
6. Evaluate model
7. Decide if business outcome was accomplished
