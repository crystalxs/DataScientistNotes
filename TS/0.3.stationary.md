# 0.3. Stationary

A time series model is the specification of the joint distribution of the random variables in {$Y_t$}:

$P(Y_1 \leq y_1, Y_2 \leq y_2, ..., Y_n \leq y_n)$ where $y_1, y_2, ..., y_n \in R$.

However, specifying such a joint distribution is typically infeasible in practice since there typically won't be enough information to estimate all of the parameters required. But most of distribution characteristics can be described with $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ moments:

* mean: $E[Y_t] \; t = 1,2,...$
* variance/ covariance: $E[Y_t, Y_{t+h}] \; t=1, 2, ..., h \geq 0$

## Strictly Stationary

A time series {$Y_t$} is a strictly stationary if the joint distribution of $Y_{t_1}, Y_{t_2},...,Y_{t_n}$ is the same as $Y_{t_{1+h}}, Y_{t_{2+h}},...,Y_{t_{n+h}}$ for all $t_1,..., t_n, h \in Z$. Thus, the joint distribution is preserved under time shifts.

## Weakly Stationary

A time series {$Y_t$} with finite variance is said to weakly stationary if:

- $E(Y_t) = \mu$ is independent of $t$.
- $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t+h}) = \gamma(h)$ is independent of $t$ for all $h$.

## Special Distributions

### Multivariate normal

$$
\begin{aligned}
\vec{Y} &\sim MVN(\vec \mu, \Sigma) \\
\mu_i &= E[Y_i] \\
\Sigma_{ii} &= Var(Y_i) \\
\Sigma_{ij} &= Cov(Y_i, Y_j)
\end{aligned}
$$

###IID Noise

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{ \varepsilon_t \} &\sim IID(0, \sigma^2) \\
\mu_t &= E[\varepsilon_t] = 0 \\
\Sigma_{tt} &= Var(\varepsilon_t) = \sigma^2 \\
\varepsilon_t &\; \text{and} \; \varepsilon_{t+h} \; \text{for} \; h \geq 0 \; \text{are independt}
\end{aligned}
$$

IID noise is weakly stationary.

### White Noise

$$
\begin{aligned}
\{ \varepsilon_t \} &\sim WN(0, \sigma^2) \\
\mu_t &= E[\varepsilon_t] = 0 \\
\Sigma_{tt} &= Var(\varepsilon_t) = \sigma^2 \\
\Sigma_{t(t+h)} &= Cov(\varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_{t+h}) = 0 \; \text{for} \; h \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### Random Walk

$$
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_t &= 
\begin{cases}
1 \; \text{with prob} \; \frac{1}{2} \\
-1 \; \text{with prob} \; \frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}
\Bigg\} \; \text{independently} \\
\{ s_t \} &\; \text{where} \; s_t = \sum_{i=1}^t \varepsilon_i \; \text{and} \; s_0 = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Random walk is not weakly stationary.
