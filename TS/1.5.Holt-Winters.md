# 1.5. Univariance - Holt-Winters Methodology

The objective is to predict $Y_{n+h}$ given the history of distribution {$y_1, y_2, ..., y_n$}. Using exponential smoothing techniques, we do so with a set of recursive equations that do not require distribution assumptions.

Depending on whether the data has trend and/or seasonality, we will determine different set of equations to fit data:

* no trend + no seasonality	Single/Simple exponential smoothing
* trend + no seasonality	Double exponential smoothing
* (no) trend + seasonality	Triple exponential smoothing

## Single/Simple exponential smoothing

Referred to as an Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA).

Level equations: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a_t = \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha) a_{t-1}$

Forecast equations: $\hat{y}_{t+h} = a_t$ for $h=1,2,3,...$

* $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ is a smoothing parameter
* small $\alpha$ perform more smoothing, if $\alpha = 0$, $a_t = a_0$ (super smooth)
* large $\alpha$ perform less smoothing, if $\alpha = 1$, $a_t = y_t$ (no smooth)
* $\alpha = 0.2$ is typically a good choice
* optimal value of $\alpha$ can be determined using the data in particular $\hat{\alpha}$ is the value that minimizes squared error loss function $\sum_{t=1}^n e_t^2 = \sum_{t=1}^n (y_t - \hat{y_t})^2$
* $\hat{y}_{t+h} = a_t = \alpha \sum_{i=0}^{t-1} (1-\alpha)^i y_{t-i} + (1-\alpha)^t a_0$ where $a_0$ is the initial value of the recursion, a common choice of $a_0$ is $\bar{y}$

## Double exponential smoothing

Level equations: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a_t = \alpha y_t + (1-\alpha) (a_{t-1} + b_{t-1})$

Weighted average of the observed response of time $t$ and the models corresponding prediction of that observation from time point $t-1$

Trend equations: $b_t = \beta (a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}$

Weighted average of current trend component and historical prediction of that some component

Forecast equations: $\hat{y}_{t+h} = a_t +h b_t$ for $h=1,2,3,...$

- $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$ are smoothing parameters
- small values perform more smoothing
- large values perform less smoothing
- both parameters can be determined by minimizing squared error loss function $\sum_{t=1}^n e_t^2 = \sum_{t=1}^n (y_t - \hat{y_t})^2$

## Triple exponential smoothing

###Addictive

Level equations: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a_t = \alpha (y_t - s_{t-m}) + (1-\alpha) (a_{t-1} + b_{t-1})$

Weighted average of the seasonal adjusted observed response of time $t$ and a non-seasonal forecast of it

Trend equations: $b_t = \beta (a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}$

Seasonal equation: $s_t = \gamma (y_t - a_{t-1} - b_{t-1}) + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m}$

Weighted average between the current index and the seasonal index of the same period in the previous season

Forecast equations: $\hat{y}_{t+h} = a_t +h b_t+ s_{t+h-m} $ for $h=1,2,3,...$

- $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ are smoothing parameters

### Multiplicative

when heteroscedasticity is present, we may opt to use a multiplicative version

Level equations: $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a_t = \alpha (\frac{y_t}{s_{t-m}}) + (1-\alpha) (a_{t-1} + b_{t-1})$

Trend equations: $b_t = \beta (a_t - a_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1}$

Seasonal equation: $s_t = \gamma (\frac{y_t}{a_{t-1} + b_{t-1}}) + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m}$

Forecast equations: $\hat{y}_{t+h} = a_t +h b_t+ s_{t+h-m} $ for $h=1,2,3,...$

- $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$ are smoothing parameters
