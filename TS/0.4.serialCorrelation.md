# 0.4. Serial Correlation

##Auto-covariance function

$\gamma(h) = \gamma(t, t+h) = cov(Y_t, Y_{t+h})$ is called autocovaiance function.

Properties:

- $\gamma(0) \geq 0 \Leftrightarrow Var[Y_t] \geq 0$
- $|\gamma(h)| \leq \gamma(0)$
- $\gamma(h) = \gamma(-h)$

## Auto-correlation function

$$
\begin{split}
\rho(h) = cor(Y_t, Y_{t+h}) &= \frac{cov(Y_t, Y_{t+h})}{\sqrt{Var(Y_t)} \sqrt{Var{Y_{t+h}}}} \\
&= \frac{cov(Y_t, Y_{t+h})}{\sqrt{cov(Y_t, Y_t)} \sqrt{cov{Y_{t+h}, Y_{t+h}}}} \\
&= \frac{\gamma(h)}{\gamma(0)} \\
\end{split}
$$

Properties

* $|\rho(h)| = \frac{|\gamma(h)|}{\gamma(0)} \leq 1$
* $\rho(h) = \rho(-h)$

In practice, we observe data and calculate sample estimates of these quantities, thus given an observed time series {$y_t$} = {$y_1, y_2, y_3, ..., y_m$}:

* Sample mean function: $\hat{\mu} (t) = \bar{y} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^m y_t$
* Sample auto covariance function: $\hat{\gamma} (h) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n-|h|} (y_t-\bar{y})(y_{t-|h|}-\bar{y})$
* Sample autocorrelation function: $\hat{\rho} (h) = \frac{\hat{\gamma}(h)}{\hat{\gamma}(0)}$

In practice, we use the sample ACF value to determine whether the observed time series is correlated. We can determine a threshold where if $\rho(h)$ lies beyond this threshold, the correlation at lag $h$ is dreamed to be significant. These threshold are calculated in the context of the fact that asymptotically: $\hat{\rho}(h) \sim N(0, \frac{1}{n})$. If the time series is uncorrelated, the threshold is calculated as $\pm 1.96 \sqrt{n}$ and $\hat{\rho}(h) \notin [-1.96 \sqrt{n}, 1.96 \sqrt{n}]$ indicate significant lag $h$ correlation. 

## Partial Autocorrelation

The ACF of lag $h$ measures the correlation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t+h}$. This correlation could be due to a direct relationship between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t+h}$, or it may influenced by observations of the intermediate lays, $Y_{t+1}, Y_{t+2}, ..., Y_{t+h-1}$. The PACF of lag $h$ measured the correlation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t+h}$ after accounting the influence of this intermediate lags. we do this by considering:

* $\hat{Y}_t = f(Y_{t+1}, Y_{t+2}, ..., Y_{t+h-1})$

* $\hat{Y}_{t+h} = g(Y_{t+1}, Y_{t+2}, ..., Y_{t+h-1})$

For a time series {$Y_t$} the PACF of lag $h$ is:
$$
\alpha(h) = \Bigg\{
\begin{split}
& corr(Y_t, Y_t) = 1 & \;\text{if}\; h=0 \\
& corr(Y_t, Y_{t+1}) = \rho(1) & \;\text{if}\; h = 1 \\
& corr(Y_t-\hat{Y}_t, Y_{t+h}-\hat{Y}_{t+h}) & \;\text{if}\; h \geq 2
\end{split}
$$
