> Data structures group or encode relationships between data elements.

> #### Advice
>
> * Using the simplest data structure you can initially
> * Wasting processor, memory power before brianpower
> * There is a trade off between time and space (always)
> * Prep work or more sophisticated data structure can help (???)

## Methods

- Physical adjacency or relative position in RAM
- Pointers

### Elemental data in memory (primitive types)



### Pointer Data Type

A pointer p is implemented as an integer variable that holds a memory address.

- All the variable in python is a reference to the piece of data and not data itself
