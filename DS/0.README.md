# 3.2. Data Structure

Data structures group or encode relationships between data elements.

#### Advice

* Using the simplest data structure you can initially

* Wasting processor, memory power before brianpower
* There is a trade off between time and space (always)
* Prep work or more sophisticated data structure can help (???)

## Methods

- Physical adjacency or relative position in RAM
- Pointers

## Type

| Abstract data type | Implementation data type |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| list               | array                    |
| dictionary         | hashtable                |
|                    |                          |

### Elemental data in memory

* int, float, string
* np.float32, np.float64
* 

### List

* Array implementations is most common for list abstract data structure
* Lists are ordered but items aren't necessarily sortable
* crcrystal

### Set

### Queue

### Stack

### Dictionary

### Binary tree

### Graph
