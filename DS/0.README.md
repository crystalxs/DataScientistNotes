# Data Structure

> Data structures group or encode relationships between data elements.

#### Advice

- Using the simplest data structure you can initially
- Wasting processor, memory power before brianpower
- There is a trade off between time and space (always)
- Prep work or more sophisticated data structure can help (???)

## Methods

- Physical adjacency or relative position in RAM
- Pointers

## Type

| Abstract data type | Implementation data type |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| list               | array                    |
| dictionary         | hashtable                |
|                    |                          |

### Pointer Data Type

A pointer p is implemented as an integer variable that holds a memory address.

- All the variable in python is a reference to the piece of data and not data itself
