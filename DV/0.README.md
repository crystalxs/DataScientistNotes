## Tips

1. Keep simple
2. Have **a** specific message you want to communicate
3. Select the right chart form (do not use Pie chart)
4. Use compelling **headlines** and decks to describe the take-away message of the visualization. 
   - Include a compelling headline to orient the viewer and communicate the main focus of the visualization. Do not capitalize all letters or make them bold. 
   - Label the axes. Labels should always be printed horizontally to make them easier to read. 
   - Use decks to describe what is depicted and to avoid any potential misinterpretation. 
   - Provide source information to establish credibility. 
5. Maximize the data-ink ratio (Edward Tufte) 
   * Show the data above everything else. Eliminate all extra ink that does not show the data. Exclude redundant information, including background color, borders, and grids. 
6. Avoid using special effects, such as 3D graphics.
7. Add hierarchy to your data 
8. Use colour, size, and position to help the reader see what is important
9. Find the models you like and use them in your designs, or
   adapt them to fit your needs
10. Revise and edit
