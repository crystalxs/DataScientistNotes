# Terminology

## Data Visualization 

- Communicates non-visual data visually
- Results should be readable and recognizable* 
- Transforms raw data into information 

###Scientific visualization

- Visualizes scientific data (1D, 2D, or 3D data points) 

- Data often scalar or vector fields from computer 

  simulations 

- Aims to convey scientific data accurately 

- Aims to reveal underlying structure in data 

- Aims to encourage exploration of data (interactivity) 

### Information visualization 

- Visualizes abstract data (has no inherent physical form) 

- Data may be numerical, categorical, temporal, geospatial, or 

  textual/unstructured 

- Aims to convey abstract data accurately 

- Aims to reveal underlying structure in data 

- Aims to encourage exploration of data (interactivity) 

- Aims to display data aesthetically 

##Infographics 

- Visualizes abstract data (has no inherent physical form) 
- Aims to be eye-catching and capture attention 
- Aims to convey information quickly 
- *Might not be accurate* 
- *Might not use space efficiently* 
- *Might not encourage exploration of data* 

##Statistical Graphics 

- Visualizes statistical data (also considered abstract) 
- Data may be statistical, quantitative, or numerical 
- Aims to convey statistical data accurately 
- Aims to convey underlying structure in data 
- *Less emphasis on being aesthetically pleasing?* 
- *Less emphasis on exploration and interactivity?* 

## Visual Analytics 

- Visualizes abstract data (has no inherent physical form) 
- Aims to answer a specific question (goal-oriented) 
- Aims to support analytical reasoning with interactive visual interfaces 
- Aims to support expert users, not general public 
- *Less emphasis on being aesthetically pleasing?* 
- *May not be constrained by a single display?* 

##Information Dashboards 

* Visualizes temporal data/time series (also considered abstract) 

* Aims to convey large amount of information quickly â€¢ Aims to convey outliers and trends at a glance
* Might not be interactive (view-only)

##Informative Art

- Sometimes known as ambient visualization 
- Visualizes abstract data (has no inherent physical form) 
- Aims to make visualization ambient or a part of everyday life 
- Aims to be aesthetically pleasing 
- *Might not be informative* 
- *Might not be eye catching*
