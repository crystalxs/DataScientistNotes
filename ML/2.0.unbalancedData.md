# 2.0. Unbalanced Data

If we want to split on a feature, it would be best if both features are relatively balanced.

In Regression, we want to predict a value. It is best if all possible values are equally represented.

You can:

- Filter data without enough samples (aka, ingore)
- Resample data
- You fit more appropriate algorithms (e.g., Bayesian Regression)

## Techniques

1. Ignore it
2. Go get more data
3. Resample
4. Pick an appropriate evaluation metrics
5. Pick an appropriate algorithm
6. Pick an appropriate loss function

### Ignore it

It might not matter (seriously).

Small-ish differences at large scale might not effect business outcomes.

### More data

Pay the money and time to get more data!

### Resampling

1. Over sample minority group, eg SMOTE
2. Under sample majority group
3. Representative sampling of both groups

### Evaluation Metrics

Avoid accuracy. Use F-score.

### Robust algorithm

eg. SVM is very robust to class Imbalances.

### Loss function

Weight mistakes for smaller classes more highly than mistakes for larger classes.
