## Remove

> There are valid reasons for throwing away outliers. For example, a measurement resulting from a human error. In general throwing away observations is a questionable practice.

## Filtering / Thresholding

> ~~Always perform EDA (especially univariate).~~ Remove out-of-bound values

- Prevent out-of-bound values (mostly for unreasonable x)
- Defining outliers / anomaly detection
  - Outliers generated by the **same** statistical process as your data (just unusual spread)
  - Outliers generated by a **different** statistical process as your data

## Clip Outliers

> If we see outliers that don't make sense you can discard observations with > 99% quantile or <1% quantile. Or you can "clip" by changing the values to the 99% quantile or 1% quantile. Here is an example.

```pythono
{92, 19, 101, 58, 1053, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, -40, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, -5, 41} 
to
{92, 19, 101, 58, 101, 91, 26, 78, 10, 13, -5, 101, 86, 85, 15, 89, 89, 28, -5, 41}
```
