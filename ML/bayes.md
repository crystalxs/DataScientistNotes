# Naive Bayes

> Using Bayes rule allowing us to evaluate our hypothesis, give our prior beliefs and new evidence.

**Likelihood**: how likely we are to observe the data point given a specific label.

**Class Prior (base-rate)**: how likely we are to observe each of the label, ignoring the data.

**Predictor Prior Probability**: how likely we are to observe any given data point $p(doc)$.

**Posterior Probability**: predict probability of a label given a new observation. **Goal** of machine learning classi
