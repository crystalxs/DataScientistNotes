# 3.5. Machine Learning

##What is Machine Learning

###Informal definition

Learn a function from data that can generalize to predict new data.

- Learn: not explicitly program
- Function: a computer function with inputs & outputs
- Data:
- Generalize to new data:

The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

###Modern definition

A computer program is said to learn from experience (E) with respect to some class of tasks (T) and performance measure (P), if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

*Example:*

playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

## Typical ML Workflow

1. Load tidy data
2. Split into train and test sets
3. Do feature engineering
4. Choose hyperparameters
5. Fit model
6. Evaluate model
7. Decide if business outcome was accomplished
