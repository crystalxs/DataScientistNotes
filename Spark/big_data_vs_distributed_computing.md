# Big Data VS Distributed Computing

## Big Data

Size and structure is beyond the ability of traditional data-processing application software can adequately handle.

### Size

Constantly moving target - as of 2012 ranging from terabytes (TB) to exabytes (EB).

### Structure

Mostly unstructured.

## Distributed Computing

For processing large volumes of data fast, scale out instead of scale up.

### Cheaper

Run large data on clusters of many smaller and cheaper machines.

### Reliable

If one node or process fails, its workload should be assumed by other components in the system.

### Faster

It parallelizes and distributes computations.Big Data VS Distributed Computing
