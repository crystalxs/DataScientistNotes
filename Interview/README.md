## Interview Approach

> Reference: Brain career workshop slides

1. Ask - ALWAYS ask follow-up questions. Almost all technical questions are underspecified. It shows you are curious and do not make assumptions.
2. Suppose - State the givens. For example, "I'm going to code in Python with its Standard Library"
3. Plan - Outline what you plan to do. For example, create placeholder functions then fill them in. 
4. Code - Note this is step 4. You need to this but do not jump right to it.
5. Test - Double check your code with common examples and edge cases.
6. Refactor - Rename variables, erase unnecessary parts, improve performance, and think about scalability...





##Python attention

* `len//2 = int(len/2)`;
* When two integers are divided, the result is a floating point;
* continue assign: the right hand side variable is not the variable itself, it only a pointer
* the variable will hold a **reference** to a piece of data and **not the data itself**.
