## Coding Style

### Python PEP8

### [Bug Free](#Testing)

### Readability

- Use constant value to store the pre-defined value

## Testing

> https://medium.com/@umerfarooq_26378/software-testing-concepts-24d747ae35bb
>
> The **process of verifying and validating** that a software program or application or product:
>
> * Meets the business and technical requirements.
> * Works as expected.
> * Can be implemented with the same characteristic

### General Testing Terms

**Bug** is the result of a coding error.

**Defect** is the difference between expected and actual result in the context of testing.

**Error** normally arises in software Error means to change the functionality of the program.

**Fault** A wrong or mistaken step, process or Data definition in a computed program which causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner.

**Failure** is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements.

* When a defect reaches the end customer it is called a failure and if the defect is detected internally and resolved it’s called a defect.

### Testing Objectives

The major objectives of Software testing are as follows:

- Finding and prevent defects.
- Gaining confidence to gain the level of quality.
- To make sure that the end result meets the business and user requirements and specifications.

### Testing Principles

There are following seven principles of testing:

1. Testing shows presence of defects
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing
4. Defect clustering
5. Pesticide paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence of errors fallacy

### Fundamental Test Process

#### 1. Planning and Control

Test planning has following major tasks:

- To determine the scope and risks.
- To identify the objectives of testing.
- To determine the test approach.
- To implement the test policy and/or the test strategy.
- To determine the required test resources like people, test environments, PCs, etc.
- To schedule test analysis, test design, test implementation, execution & evaluation.
- To determine the exit criteria.

#### 2. Analysis and Design

Analysis and Design has following major tasks:

- To review the test basis.
- To identify test conditions.
- To design the tests.
- To evaluate test ability of the requirements and system.
- To design the test environment set-up and identify and required infrastructure and tools.

#### 3. Implementation and Execution

Implementation and Execution has following major tasks:

- To develop and prioritize our test cases
- To create test suites from the test cases for efficient test execution.
- To implement and verify the environment.
- To execute test suites and individual test cases.
- To re-execute the tests that previously failed in order to confirm a fix.
- To log the outcome of the test execution.
- To compare actual results with expected results.
- Report discrepancies as Incidents.

#### 4. Evaluating exit criteria and Reporting

Evaluating Exit Criteria and Reporting has following major tasks:

- To check the test logs against the exit criteria specified in test planning.
- To assess if more test are needed or if the exit criteria specified should be changed.
- To write a test summary report for stakeholders.

#### 5. Test Closure activities

Test Closure activities has following major tasks:

- To check which planned deliverable are actually delivered.
- To ensure that all incident reports have been resolved.
- To finalize and archive test ware such as scripts, test environments, etc.
- To handover the test ware to the maintenance organization.
- To evaluate how the testing went and learn lessons for future releases and projects.

### Test Approach

**Unit Test:** It is basically done by the developers to make sure that their code is working fine and meet the user specifications. They test their piece of code

**Integration Test:** Integration testing is done when two modules are integrated, in order to test the behavior and functionality of both the modules after integration. Below are few types of integration testing:

- Big bang integration testing
- Top down
- Bottom up
- Functional incremental

**System Test:** In system testing the testers basically test the compatibility of the application with the system.

**Acceptance testing:** are basically done to ensure that the requirements of the specification are met.

**Alpha testing:** is done at the developers site. It is done at the end of the development process

**Beta testing:** is done at the customers site. It is done just before the launch of the product.

**Functional Testing:** This is a type of black-box testing that is based on the specifications of the software that is to be tested.

**Non-Functional Testing:** involves testing a software from the requirements which are nonfunctional in nature but important such as performance, security, user interface, etc.

**Smoke Testing:** also known as “Build Verification **Testing**” Smoke testing is a wide approach where all areas of the software application are tested without getting into too deep. Smoke testing is done to ensure whether the main functions of the software application are working or not.

**Sanity software:** testing is a narrow regression testing with a focus on one or a small set of areas of functionality of the software application. Sanity test is generally without test scripts or test cases.

**Black Box Testing:** The technique of testing without having any knowledge of the interior workings of the application is called black-box testing. The tester is oblivious to the system architecture and does not have access to the source code.

**White-box testing:** is the detailed investigation of internal logic and structure of the code. White-box testing is also called **glass testing** or **open-box testing**

**Grey-box testing:** is a technique to test the application with having a limited knowledge of the internal workings of an application.

**Regression Testing:** is performed to verify that a fixed bug hasn’t resulted in another functionality or business rule violation.

**Load Testing:** It is a process of testing the behavior of a software by applying maximum load in terms of software accessing and manipulating large input data.

**Performance testing:** is the process of determining the speed or effectiveness of a computer, network, software program or device. This process can involve quantitative tests done in a lab, such as measuring the response time or the number of MIPS (millions of instructions per second) at which a system functions.

**Security Testing:** involves testing a software in order to identify any flaws and gaps from security and vulnerability point of view.

**Compatibility Testing:** is a type of Software testing to check whether your software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications , network environments or Mobile devices

**Usability testing:** is a black-box technique and is used to identify any error(s) and improvements in the software by observing the users through their usage and operation.

**Stress testing:** includes testing the behavior of a software under abnormal conditions Load Testing

**Portability testing:** includes testing a software with the aim to ensure its reusability and that it can be moved from another software as well.

**Compatibility Testing:** is a type of Software testing to check whether your software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications , network environments or Mobile devices

**User Acceptance (UAT):** During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications.

## Interview Approach

> Reference: Brain career workshop slides

1. Ask - ALWAYS ask follow-up questions. Almost all technical questions are underspecified. It shows you are curious and do not make assumptions.
2. Suppose - State the givens. For example, "I'm going to code in Python with its Standard Library"
3. Plan - Outline what you plan to do. For example, create placeholder functions then fill them in. 
4. Code - Note this is step 4. You need to this but do not jump right to it.
5. Test - Double check your code with common examples and edge cases.
6. Refactor - Rename variables, erase unnecessary parts, improve performance, and think about scalability...

## Python attention

- `len//2 = int(len/2)`;
- when two integers are **divided**, the result is a floating point;
- **continue assign**: the right hand side variable is not the variable itself, it only a pointer;
- the variable will hold a **reference** to a piece of data and **not the data itself**;
- avoid using `or` in assignment, it dangerous;

## Time Complexity

* $O(1)$ 极少
* $O(logn)$ 几乎都是二分法
* $O(\sqrt n)$ 几乎是分解质因数
* $O(n)$ 高频
* $O(nlogn)$ 一般都可能要排序
* $O(n^2$) 数组，枚举，动态规划
* $O(n^3)$ 数组，枚举，动态规划
* $O(2^n)$ 与组合有关的搜索
* $O(n!)$ 与排列有关的搜索
