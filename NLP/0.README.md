# Neuro Linguistic Programming

##What is NLP?

NLP is a broad field, encompassing a variety of tasks, including:

- Part-of-speech tagging: identify if each word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Named entity recognition NER): identify person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, etc)
- Question answering
- Speech recognition
- Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text
- Topic modeling
- Sentiment classification
- Language modeling
- Translation

##Topic Modeling with NMF and SVD

- Stop words, stemming, & lemmatization
- Term-document matrix
- Topic Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- Truncated SVD, Randomized SVD

##Sentiment classification with Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, and ngrams

- Sparse matrix storage
- Counters
- the fastai library
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic regression
- Ngrams
- Logistic regression with Naive Bayes features, with trigrams

##Regex (and re-visiting tokenization)

##Language modeling & sentiment classification with deep learning

- Language model
- Transfer learning
- Sentiment classification

##Translation with RNNs

- Review Embeddings
- Bleu metric
- Teacher Forcing
- Bidirectional
- Attention

##Translation with the Transformer architecture

- Transformer Model
- Multi-head attention
- Masking
- Label smoothing

##Bias & ethics in NLP

- bias in word embeddings
- types of bias
- attention economy
- drowning in fraudulent/fake info
