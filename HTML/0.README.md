# HTML

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
- HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
- HTML elements are represented by tags
- HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page



## HTML Documents

* All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
* The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.
* The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`.

### The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is not case sensitive.

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration for HTML5 is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### HTML Tags

HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

```html
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>
```

- HTML tags normally come **in pairs** like `<p>` and `</p>`
- The first tag in a pair is the **start tag,** the second tag is the **end tag**
- The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a **forward slash** inserted before the tag name

*The start tag is also called the **opening tag**, and the end tag the **closing tag**.*

### HTML Page Structure

Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

```html
<html>

    <head>

        <title>Page title</title>

    </head>

    <body>

        <h1>This is a heading</h1>

        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

    </body>

</html>
```

#### HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.
