# Query Review

### Select Columns

```text
SELECT ______
FROM _______;
```

SQL ignores hard returns, additional white space and is case insensitive.

```text
SELECT * FROM table; # return all columns
```

### Filtering rows

```text
SELECT ______
FROM ______
WHERE ______;
```

For string itself is case-sensitive. We use single quotes to select string.
