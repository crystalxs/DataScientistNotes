##Find Canonical User ID

**REF:** https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html

You can find the AWS account ID from AWS Management Console. The method that you use to find the account ID depends on how you are logged in to the console.

**To view your AWS account ID when signed in as an AWS account root user**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) as the root user.

   Important

   If you are signed in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) with *IAM user*credentials, you must sign out and then sign in as the root user. If you see the account-specific IAM user sign-in page, choose **Sign-in using root account credentials** near the bottom of the page to return to the main sign-in page. From there, you can type your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the root user.

2. In the top right of the console, choose your account name or number. Then choose**My Security Credentials**.

3. If necessary, in the dialog box, choose **Continue to Security Credentials**. You can choose the box next to **Donâ€™t show me this message again** to stop the dialog box from appearing in the future.

4. Expand the **Account Identifiers** section to view your AWS account ID.
