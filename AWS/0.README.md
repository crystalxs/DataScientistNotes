>How to create virtual machine on Amazon Web Services

### Create an instance

Login to AWS, and before create Virtual machine, change the region to Oregon, which is tax-free state and will be cheaper. \(On the top-right corner\)

Go to your [AWS console](http://aws.amazon.com/console) and click on the "EC2" link.

Click "Launch Instance", which will start the process to create a virtual machine in the cloud. An instance is just a virtual machine.

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/launch.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/launch.png)

Select the machine you want. This is a commonly-used "image" that results in a Linux machine that contains lots of useful goodies as you can see from that list, such as Python and MySQL. An image is just a snapshot of the disk after someone carefully installs software properly on a Linux machine. This means we don't have to install software every time we create a new machine.

Select instance type. Click "Review and launch"

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/selectvm.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/selectvm.png)

This will bring up a screen describing the details about the instance we are launching. Ignore all of it for now and just click "Review and Launch" at the bottom right. That brings up a summary page that we could examine if we wanted, but just click "Launch" in bottom right.

This will bring a dialog box up to select a key pair. A key pair is what allows you to securely access the server and prevent unauthorized access. The **first time \(also after changing region\)**, you will need to create a new key pair. Name it as your user ID then click on "Download key pair." It will download a `userid.pem` file, which are your security credentials for getting into the machine. **Save that file in a safe spot.** If you lose it you will not be able to get into the machine that you create. From now on, you can reuse that pre-existing key.

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/keypair.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/keypair.png)

After downloading, click "Launch instances." You should see something like:

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/launched.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/launched.png)

Click on the `i-...` link to go to the EC2 console showing your instance.

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/ec2-instance.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/ec2-instance.png)

Click on your instance and you should see a description box at the bottom. Look for the "**Public IP**" address, which is 54.196.174.210 in this case:

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/publicIP.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/publicIP.png)

We have to wait until the status stops saying "Initializing", which could take several minutes.

### Connecting to the remote server

Click on the "Connect" button at the top of the page and it will bring up a dialog box that tells you how to connect to the server. You want to connect with "A standalone SSH client" link \(Java is now a security risk in the browser so we can't use that choice.\) Inside you will see the `ssh` command necessary to connect to your machine. If you have Windows, there is a link to show you how to use an SSH client called PuTTY.

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/connect.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/connect.png)

Before we can connect, we have to **make sure that the security file is not visible to everyone on the computer \(other users\)**. Otherwise ssh will not let us connect because the security file is not secure:

```text
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for '/Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
bad permissions: ignore key: /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem
Permission denied (publickey).
```

Whoa! Do this:

```text
$ cd ~/Dropbox/licenses
$ ls -l parrt.pem
-rw-r--r--@ 1 parrt  parrt  1696 Aug  4 15:15 /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licences/parrt.pem
```

To fix the permissions, we can use whatever "show information about file" GUI your operating system has or, from the command line, do this:

```text
$ cd ~/Dropbox/licenses
$ chmod 400 parrt.pem
```

which changes the permissions like this:

```text
$ ls -l parrt.pem
-r--------@ 1 parrt  501  1696 Aug  1 12:12 /Users/parrt/Dropbox/licenses/parrt.pem
```

For mac and linux users, under the same directory of your key pair, copy the command from dialog box under example. Or provide the full pathname to your `userid.pem` file

Try to connect again and it will now warn you that you have never connected to that machine before. Again, this is a security measure. You can simply say "yes" here.

```text
$ ssh -i parrt.pem ec2-user@54.196.174.210
The authenticity of host '54.196.174.210 (54.196.174.210)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:BYGiV2qRthhw52HQni5vnoRtiT16cplmdbXAuXqQdqc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '54.196.174.210' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

8 package(s) needed for security, out of 17 available
Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.

```

The `$` is your prompt just like you have on your local machine using the terminal / shell, but you are giving commands to a remote server not your local machine.

### Prepare virtual machine

Some virtual machines do not have the software we need, then we need to install them

```text
sudo yum install python3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install unzip
sudo pip3 install numpy gunicorn Flask #install python3 package
```

#### Get file on your virtual machine

1. Use github
2. For larger files, we need to use the secure copy `scp` command that has the same argument structure as secure shell `ssh`. Get another shell running on your laptop. Download data file [cheese\_deaths.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrt/msan501/master/projects/regression/data/cheese_deaths.csv) and store on your laptop in the directory where you are currently working on the laptop command line. Now, in a shell **on your laptop**, use the following command \(that is similar to `ssh`\) to copy it to the remote computer. The general form of the command is: `scp -i your-pem-file file-to-copy user@machine-name:directory-on-remote-machine`
3. Download file from website: 

   ```text
   $ wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/msan692/glove.6B.300d.txt.zip`
   ```

### Set you virtual machine as a server

#### Add inbound rules

Set the **Security Groups**

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2822%29.png)

Under the inbound tab, select Edit.

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

Add the port 5000 to the inbound rules.

### Terminate your instance

To exit the remote server, type `exit` or use `^D` from the `$` prompt. The machine will still be running but you're no longer connected to it from your laptop.

Play around with your instance and then **TERMINATE YOUR INSTANCE WHEN YOU ARE DONE**, otherwise you will continue to get charged for the use of that machine. Right-click on the instance from your AWS console and select "instance state" then submenu "terminate". It will warn you that all of your local storage will go away. Hit the "yes, terminate" button. It should look like this when done:

[![](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/raw/master/notes/images/terminated.png)](https://github.com/parrt/msds501/blob/master/notes/images/terminated.png)

If you say "stop" instead, it will stop the machine, but you still get charged. On the other hand, this is useful because you can restart that machine without having to go through this whole procedure. All of your data will be intact. If you say "Terminate", it will toss the machine out and you will have to go through this procedure again to get a new machine.
